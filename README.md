# GPT-5

GPT-5 is a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarizationâ€”all without task-specific training.

GPT-5 is a transformer-based language model that was trained on a dataset of 45TB of text. It is the largest transformer-based language model ever trained, and is the first to break the billion parameter mark.

GPT-5 is a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP) research. It can be used to generate text, answer questions, and perform other language-related tasks. GPT-5 can also be used to create applications such as chatbots, question-answering systems, and summarization systems.
